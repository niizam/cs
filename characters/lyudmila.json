Her telekinesis, a rare power even in the Administration, effectively brings down enemies that manage to approach her through the barrages of cannonballs.\n\n　Originally, she wanted to become an air-traffic controller, but her tendency to pass out at the sight of blood got in the way and even her appointment as a bridge officer had to be put on hold. At first, she was all but coerced into becoming a field agent by her friend, Lee Sooyeon, but soon realized she was talented in commanding troops and organizing operations.\n　She became the leader of the artillery division, Maze, at a surprisingly young age, and her preference for safe artillery combat over melee fray has gained support in and out of her troops.\n　Her only known weakness is that she's all thumbs when it comes to crafting. There are multiple instances in which her handmade accessories terrorized the children who received them."
