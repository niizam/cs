This is not well-known, but according to his men, he worked from the shadows to neutralize political traps and attacks directed at his steadfast superior.\n　Some military historians even believe that Reginald was the reason the Lieutenant General stayed in power for as long as she did; not because of his political acumen, but also because of his ability to fight, which helped him distinguish himself on the battlefield time and again as the Lieutenant General's right-hand man.\n He's a soldier through and through, as his militant appearance suggests. A report by the United Forces, however, says that he's so strong in his own convictions that he could pose new problems."
