He usually carries out control missions, but he launches powerful area attacks in battle to turn the tide.\n\n　He is one of the few agents who can assess a situation from a wide perspective. Because he always moves with the post-combat situation in mind, he often gets scolded by other division members for letting his mind wander.\n　Although Na Yubin has been offered a commander training course by several units he worked with, he keeps refusing the offer for the reason that he still has a lot to learn from Fenrir Division. In response to this, the commander commented that he should first deviate from textbook methodology. "
