Of course, she does not believe that the Bureau's choice is necessarily right, and she\nShe appears to be willing to give advice.\nPeople often have preconceptions about Fatima because of her fierce appearance, but in fact, she is calm in everything. She is serious and shows an infinitely warm attitude towards children."
