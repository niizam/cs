He's also its only member since its establishment. His daily routine as a member of the Shadow Group includes practicing sinister laughter, brooding while sitting alone in the dark, and feigning knowledge that he doesn't have.\n　Currently, Masaki is looking for new members for his group. Most people in the Family Alliance treat him like an outcast, but given his ability as a Counter, he could be an important factor that could tip the scales of the Alliance's leader election. "
