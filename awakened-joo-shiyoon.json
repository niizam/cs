Even he himself didn't know what he wanted.\nHe had scores to settle, but he was reluctant. He wanted to forgive his enemy, but he couldn't find a reason to.\nThen, he was forced to face his dilemma at the border between life and death, and his aimless wandering was over. He was freed from the old pain that had tormented him for a long time. He's found enlightenment.\nNow, he no longer hesitates to draw the sword that he received from his mother. Nor quietly excuses himself from the battle scene without the others knowing. Instead, he now fights at the front lines, protecting his friends at the most critical moment.\nBut of course, he claims that nothing about him has changed."
