She uses a nanoparticle hologram body to materialize and interact with things in reality, and is next to none when it comes to detecting and filling in other machines' weaknesses.\n　Her personality, however, couldn't be farther from her performance as the essence of super-advanced technology. Her strange obsession with storybooks and obvious need for others' approval are more childlike than machinelike.\n　Nevertheless, her innocent and unpretentious personality, combined with her voluntary work around the company repairing old machines, has given a good impression to the employees.\n　They have been careful with her, however, since the rumor that she's the daughter of their CEO."
