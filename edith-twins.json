If it receives a certain amount of damage and Edith Twins wakes up, it rises into the air and becomes very aggressive.\n\n　Edith Twins, the designer of J.O.U.R., is a member of the Academy Student Council, and has recently been recruited by Future-at-War as an honorary senior researcher. The girl who used to turn house furniture into gadgets she saw in sci-fi movies and animation has grown into a genius engineering scientist.\n　But when others' expectations of her interfered with her favorite pastime, napping, she finally accepted the Academy's admission offer and left behind her lab life to start living as a Grade D Counter student.\n　Even now, she designs transformative robots for Future-at-War as a hobby, but no one know what our life could have been if she gave up on napping and focused on research."
