But Ingrid chose to become a witch because she just wanted to become stronger than anyone. \n　She always fails to control her competitive spirit and searches for strong opponents to fight. But that is also why she ended up working at a cafe. She was defeated after blindly challenging the most powerful witch to a duel. And as a consequence, she had to sign a contract to work at the cafe to pay off the damages she caused during the duel.\n　She often serves food while doing a handstand because she believes a comfortable work environment weakens her. And doing so usually results in her getting knocked down by the owner. But there are VVIP Customers who visit the cafe on purpose to see her eccentric actions. "
