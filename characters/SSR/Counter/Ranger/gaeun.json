When she was getting used to a life of risking it all just for a piece of bread, she received help from an unknown savior— Teacher—and came out into the world.\n　Her only wish is to meet her Teacher again. The reason why she joined HRT Berry without even having a clue about streaming was because Choi Ina convinced her that her Teacher might recognize her if she became famous.\n　She threw other members in panic by not saying a single word during their first stream, but Choi Ina advised her to smile to the camera while thinking of her Teacher. Her bright smile caused thousands of fans to fall for her. "
