Her attitude of disrespecting others still remains unchanged, but she now proudly calls herself \"garbage.\" With all the rumors put together, she is presumed to have been influenced by some kind of autosuggestion. According to an expert at the Student Council, it is very rare that a person gets hypnotized as easily as her."
