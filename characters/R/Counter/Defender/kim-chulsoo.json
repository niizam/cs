His incredible kicks that knocked down C.O. were filmed and went viral. It is said that he unconsciously copied the techniques from a video game he played in his childhood.\n　He was revered as a hero on the media, but he suffered from the trauma of the catastrophe for a while. Fortunately, he completed the rehabilitation process and decided to return to work. Instead of going back to a normal office, he applied to a TASKFORCE company to fight against C.O."
