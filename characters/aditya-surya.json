As a guide, she lacks knowledge of geography or history, and she is often unfriendly to customers, earning her a spot on the list of the worst guide candidates. However, thanks to Surya, who has saved tourists from attacks by corrosive entities, her reviews are overwhelmingly positive, resulting in a fairly high rating.\n\nWhile it currently appears that she is guiding just for the sake of taking photos, her exact purpose remains unknown."
