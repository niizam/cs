As the CEO of Tomorrow Entertainment, a MCN of minor influencers, she also acts as a field manager to ensure Project HRT Berry's success. She is very sensitive about how she's addressed, and ruthlessly bans all viewers who refers to her as Madame.\n　In the show business, she used to be the classic workaholic manager. She established her own company after arguing with her superior about bringing in too much work. Nowadays, she is keeping the HRT Berry members busy with their live streams under the title of Daily Lives of Cute Counter Girls."
