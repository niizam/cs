A veteran soldier who has survived many different battlefields, she's capable of handling Corrupted Objects and even Counters.\n\n　In the Underground, all kinds of people can be found, from able fighters who have a personal reason to hide their identities to freaks that live in their own worlds. Rivet is an outlaw encompassing both sides.\n　As if to prove her claim that she became a mercenary just for the thrill of it, she was mainly seen in the depths of the Counterside or intensely disputed territories. If there was no trouble, she created it on her own, and because of this, she was known as the most dangerous person to associate with among newcomers of the Underground. When she disappeared and didn't show up for a long time, people thought she got herself killed.\n　Lately, however, it's been confirmed that she's just joined the Society. Whatever her reason was to join, it can't have been a sound one, given her track record for reckless and dangerous behavior."
