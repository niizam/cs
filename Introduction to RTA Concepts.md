# **Introduction to Basic RTA Concepts**

# **1.0 Introduction**

## **1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this guide is to introduce new Real-Time Arena (RTA) players to common PVP concepts and detail the typical roles that form key team building considerations when assembling PVP team comps. 

There is a wealth of game knowledge hidden within the Counterside PVP gamemode that gives the game incredible replayability. With every weekly reset and a fresh set of bans, RTA opens itself up to exciting experimentation to uncover the new “meta”. This process can involve:

* Identifying and understanding the value of important RTA-oriented units  
* Understanding the relevant unit interactions on a given week  
* Researching your opponents’ comps and revising your own comp 

It can be difficult figuring out if what you’re doing is actually working. Between execution error, your opponent actively trying to undermine your efforts, and resource gaps masking otherwise bad decisions, there are numerous factors that can obfuscate more detailed analysis.

# **2.0 Expectations**

## **2.1 Can You Stop Losing? (No, and that’s ok.)**

It is important to understand that Counterside is a PVP gacha game. Differences in resource management, unit pool, and gear RNG all affect the state of an individual’s account.

It is expected you will reach a point where external factors severely hinder your ability to climb. These can take weeks to address. These “gaps” between you and your opponent may include:

* Missing core units for the week (e.g. Raphaela, Gremory, flavor-of-the-week frontline).  
* Lacking the gear to equip all your units.  
  * Lacking the (relic) gears to make certain units perform better (e.g. Inhibitor gear).  
  * Possessing less T7 Maze/ Gordias sets than your opponents.  
* Having key PVP units in your roster banned.  
* Lacking a well-invested key operator used in a given week (e.g. high skill level Serina).  
* Running a team that does poorly into the weekly meta.

As you become more familiar with your team and your unit pool, these shortcomings become easier to identify. You can queue on any given week but it may be difficult to climb. In the interests of preserving sanity, it is not uncommon for players to skip bad weeks.

**Tl;dr It is important to identify when to sit out on an unfavorable week**.

## 

## **2.2 Don’t Stereotype Divisions**

It can be unhealthy to import a “League of Legends mindset” into the game regarding divisions. That is to say, “Plat/ Masters/ Challenger players are characterized by xyz actions”, or that certain units are only good in certain divisions.

As a relatively straightforward game with a small PVP population, there is no such thing as behavior specific to a particular division. If you play correctly with the right units in a given week you will climb, and you will climb to Challenger and beyond. It’s possible to get stuck somewhere on the way up the ladder due to the aforementioned resource gaps, but it will never be due to a shift in player behavior.

The most resource-efficient way to climb in RTA is to invest in one good team (see **Section 5.0 Role Identification**), wait for a favorable week when those core units are unbanned (and the bad matchups are banned), and grind the queue. Applying this knowledge to opponents, there is little correlation between an opponent’s strength and their RTA rating. Their score is an aggregate of their performance spread across any of the season’s weekly metas.

**Tl;dr Don’t be intimidated by peoples’ RTA numbers. It does not reflect skill in the way an elo rating system would.**

# **3.0 Understanding the Core of Your Team Comp**

## **3.1 What is a Core?**

RTA teams are built around a core concept. These can be as straightforward as enabling a specific high-performance unit (e.g. Replacer King, Replacer Queen, Evolved-1), or as abstract as enabling a particular playstyle (e.g. killing the ship directly, rushing your opponent, stalling to assemble a deathball of units).

Only a few units in a team are truly essential to enabling the team’s “core concept”. The rest of the units only exist to fulfill general roles. On a given week, certain units see widespread use because they represent the best unit for fulfilling the role they occupy in their team.

The basic approach to RTA team building involves:

* Deciding on your team’s core concept  
* Determining which roles need to be fulfilled  
* Populating your team with available alternatives from the week’s options  
* Revising your team in response to its in-game performance

**Tl;dr Understand your win condition and play around it.**

To better understand what a “core concept” looks like, some example comps have been provided under section **5.0 Role Identification**.

# **4.0 Understanding the Unit Pool**

## **4.1 Frontline**

The pool of viable frontline options is mostly comprised of Defenders and Strikers.

Your opponent’s frontline stands between your team and their ship. The benefits of bringing purpose-built units capable of shredding through these frontliners are two-fold:

* Being able to kill your opponent’s frontline opens a direct path to their backline and ship.  
* Pressuring your opponent’s frontline forces them to react instead of pursuing their own plans.

Likewise, possessing all the best DPS units and multiple 76.2% Maze CDR sets doesn’t matter if your frontline dies before you can use them.

**T;dr Having a strong frontline is a prerequisite to playing the game.**

### 

### **4.1.1 Defenders**

Most SSR Defender frontline units have a stat called Max Damage Limit (MDL). From Prydwen: 

“Any incoming damage exceeding this percent of the unit’s max hp is reduced by 96%. Ingame it is listed as ‘Damage Taken Limit’.”

Besides the utility unique to a given defender’s kit, this shared MDL trait is what differentiates the role from Strikers. Defenders are well suited to tanking high damage-per-hit attacks that Strikers often struggle with.

| Common Defender Frontline Options  |  |
| ----- | :---- |
| **Counter** | RAlex, RChulsoo, AJake, ANYB, RKaci, Serapel, Levia, Lee Yumi |
| **Mech** | Mors, Horizon |
| **Soldier** | Old Admin Shieldman, Overflow\* |
| **Note:** These tables sort units by type, not team archetype. This is not to say mech comps are restricted to Mors/ Horizon, or that Counter comps shouldn’t use non-counter units. \*Overflow is a mech-soldier hybrid unit that uses soldier gear. He is a fairly uncommon unit that mostly only sees use in certain mech comps. |  |

### 

### **4.1.2 Strikers**

Contrasting Defenders, Strikers (with one exception) do not possess MDL. However, their innate \+30% Role Damage RES against Rangers and DMG TLRNC (when available) make them well-suited to tanking damage from rangers.

| Common Striker Frontline Options  |  |
| ----- | :---- |
| **Counter** | REsterosa, ROrca, Eins & Zwei, AJSY, Spira\* |
| **Mech** | Woodpecker, RTitan (More commonly played as a damage dealer) |
| **Soldier** | Old Admin Swordfighters, Veronica |
| **Note:** The striker class has too many subroles to cover within the scope of a beginner’s guide. The strikers listed are those commonly used by the community as frontline. \*Spira is an example of a more nuanced unit because she is not a traditional “HP meatball” frontline. She is often played for the utility. See **Section 4.1.4 Frontlining for Your Frontline**. |  |

### 

### **4.1.3 Off-Role Frontline Tanks**

Because most frontlines are either strikers or defenders, the majority of RTA players will run some kind of anti-striker or anti-defender DPS that diminishes the value of these types of frontliners. In contrast, nobody runs anti-supporter DPS gear to kill units like Gremory. This gives supporters and other types of non-defender/ non-striker frontliners comparable bulk (if not more) compared to other conventional frontline alternatives.

| Common Other Frontline Options  |  |
| ----- | :---- |
| **Counter** | Raphaela, Gremory, Regina, Shena, Awakened Jisoo |
| **Mech** | N/A |
| **Soldier** | RKang |
| **Note:** Technically, any non-defender/striker with a tank set becomes an “off-role” frontline tank. Some units have kits that enable this process more easily. These units largely avoid: Damage dealer anti-role gearing Role DMG ADV/ DISADV |  |

### 

### **4.1.4 Frontlining for Your Frontline**

It should come intuitively that defenders are good at tanking damage intended for strikers and vice versa. The damage difference between a sniper hitting a striker versus a defender is almost 100% (130% damage vs 70% damage).

For this reason a comp typically employs at least 1 striker and 1 defender (or one other non-striker/ non-defender frontline of comparable tankiness) so they can protect each other. 

You can expect with near certainty that in revealing your frontline, your opponent will play a particular unit to counter it. By dropping a frontline unit of a different role (stiker/ defender/ other) in front of the initial frontline deploy, it is possible to buy a lot of time, as it takes a while for your opponent to generate the DP to play the appropriate anti-x unit.

For more information on the process see **Section 6.1 Camping**.

**Tl;dr Mixing your tanks is an effective way to make your frontline last longer.**

## **4.2 Damage Dealers** 

As their value lies primarily in their damage output (with some consideration for survivability depending on the week), there is less type (counter/ mech/ soldier) bias when selecting a suitable anti-frontline damage dealer to bring into a comp. That is to say, there is more flexibility when it comes to selecting an anti-frontline option that suits one’s needs.

### 

### **4.2.1 Anti-Defenders**

Anti-defender units are purpose built to shred through Defenders. They are generally characterized (with exceptions) by their high ASPD that allows them to bypass Defender MDL. Assuming two units with the same DPS, one with high damage per hit and low ASPD, and another with low damage per hit and high ASPD, the latter’s attacks will not be affected by MDL.

Rangers are often considered for the role because it allows them to capitalize on the \+30% Role Damage ADV vs. Defenders. 

| Common Anti-Defender Options  |  |
| ----- | :---- |
| **Counter** | Gaeun, Lee Yuri, Doma |
| **Mech** | Ifrit, Sparrow |
| **Soldier** | RSorim, RRivet, Millia Rage, Old Admin Rifleman, Assault Troopers, Nicole |
| **Note:** Certain units have alternate means of dealing effectively with Defenders. Amy and AYuna have %hp burn mechanics that may not kill defenders as quickly as rangers on DPS gear, but can cover the role while also offering other advantages. |  |

### 

### **4.2.2 Anti-Strikers**

Any damage dealing unit has the potential to serve as the dedicated anti-striker DPS. In the absence of MDL, there is more flexibility in unit selection; slow ASPD high damage units (e.g. KXL, Rosaria, Rita) all do well against strikers. As with anti-defenders, the pool of available anti-strikers varies by team comp/ week. 

| Common Anti-Stiker Options  |  |  |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  | **Anti-Striker Snipers** | **Non-Sniper Alternatives** |
| **Counter** | KXL, Lyudmilia | Rita, Rosaria |
| **Mech** | Grendel | Ifrit, RTitan, Janus |
| **Soldier** | Wardens, Dorothy | Veronica, Jane Doe\* |
| **Note:** Like the Rangers-Defenders relationship, Snipers have \+30% Role DMG ADV vs. Strikers. Although snipers are powerful anti-striker options, the role as a whole typically comes with survivability issues. With most relevant snipers costing 4 DP, you can quickly run into problems: Paying 4 DP to kill a striker worth 2\~3 DP. Watching the sniper die to various backline access tools/ ship skill damage. This isn’t to say snipers are bad (on the contrary, KXL frequently reaches ban 2). Sniper damage output and range can be incredibly oppressive if left unchecked and it is because of this that people often come equipped with some means of managing them. **Tl;dr There is risk associated with using snipers. Try to mitigate them.** \*Unique to certain soldier comps, Veronica and Jane Doe sometimes see use as damage dealers. This is very uncommon. |  |  |

### 

### **4.2.3 A Note on Hypercarry Units**

Some units output a disproportionately large amount of damage that when supported properly, are capable of carrying games largely on their own. Owing to their prohibitive resource costs (DP, support and attention), these units are treated as distinct archetypes revolving around teams that enable them.

As with the above DPS units, a hypercarry comp can have intrinsically favored matchup against a particular frontline role (E.g. RQueen vs. striker frontlines) but the individual hypercarry units themselves are not generally considered within the context of searching for an anti-defender/ anti-striker option to round out a team.

| Common Hypercarry Options |  |
| ----- | :---- |
| **Counter** | ARegina, Replacer Queen, Replacer King, AJSY, RMiya |
| **Mech** | Evolved-1, Awakened Horizon |
| **Soldier** | Curian |

## 

## **4.3 Backline Access**

Backline access is more of a “concept” than a role. Broadly speaking, backline access units are capable of **directly** disrupting the enemy backline. There are a wide range of units with backline access properties. This guide primarily touches on flexible backline access units that can easily be slotted into a team without additional considerations. The criteria used are:

* Minor impact on average team DP cost  
* Little to no additional support to perform role

Example Backline Access Units and Categorization

\*Replacer Knight and Ingrid have been thoroughly powercrept out of relevance, but are included in the above graphic as that was the role they historically covered.

Backline access units represent your main way of pressuring your enemy’s backline. Similar to how anti-frontline DPS units put pressure on the enemy frontline, backline access also forces your opponent to react.

**Tl;dr Backline access is a common solution to certain squishy backline threats** 

### **4.3.0 A Note on Other Backline Access Units**

Certain units have highly impactful backline access properties in their kit that do not pass the above criteria. These units are expensive and demand varying degrees of setup and support to perform their role (e.g. AMina, RKing).

Backline access becomes the core concept of the comp rather than a means to an end. That is to say, “disrupting the backline” becomes the win condition. See **Section** **4.2.3 A Note on Hypercarry Units**; these units operate on a similar principle.

## **4.4 Supports**

Supports are force multiplier units that enable your team to output more value through some combination of healing/ shielding, ally buffing, and enemy debuffing.

### **4.4.1 Supports (Healing)**

Healers can be incredibly impactful high value units. When the team is not threatened by overwhelming amounts of damage, healers can:

* Healing your backline and mitigating the effects of chip damage.  
* Keep units alive that you would otherwise have to spend resources to redeploy.  
  * Expensive ASSR’s may cost 5\~6 DP to redeploy, but a healer can accomplish the same end goal (topping their health bar up) for 3 DP.  
  * This can snowball into a deathball of units incredibly difficult to pick apart. This forms the basis of many team comps, notably Olivie comps (See **Section 5.0 Role Identification**).  
* Enable “hospital” comps; by bringing a “hospital” of supports behind a high performance frontline unit (see also **Section** **4.2.3 A Note on Hypercarry Units**), they can win games on their own.

Counterside does not have a large pool of healers. As a majority of comps in RTA use healers, it will frequently be the case that several of the popular healers will be banned on a given week. Oftentimes, the choice of healer boils down to whoever’s left.

| Common Healer Options  |  |
| ----- | :---- |
| **Counter** | Claudia, Evelyn, Carmen, Chinatsu |
| **Mech** | N/A |
| **Soldier** | Acolytes, Ironside (heals mechs only) |

### **4.4.2 Supports (Barriers)**

Barriers grant units HP on top of their pre-existing HP bar. A barrier will tank **any amount** of damage from a single hit even if the damage exceeds the barrier’s value. Units that apply barriers provide value by:

* Protecting everyone from single-instance high damage threats (E.g. REliz, REujin) by mitigating the effects of burst damage.  
* Shielding the ship. Understanding this interaction is key to managing the “Terror” matchup (See **Section 5.0 Role Identification**).  
* Padding your units’ HP bars to reduce the impact of AOE damage.

**Tl;dr Shields can tank large single instances of damage and add bulk to units whose natural health bars are insufficient.**

| Common Barrier Options  |  |
| ----- | :---- |
| **Counter** | Arius, Yang Harim, AJia |
| **Mech** | N/A |
| **Soldier** | Revenant |

Not every RTA team uses healers/ shielders. Bringing them comes with a clear opportunity cost. The team slot may be better used by other units:

* Frontline tank  
  * Instead of supporting your pre-existing frontline, you could instead deploy a new one. Heal/Shielding a frontline tank doesn’t address the core issue: the source of incoming damage.  
  * E.g. Evolved-001 would rather run 2\~3 frontline tanks than bring a healer.  
* Damage dealer  
  * Depending on the comp, damage dealers may take higher deployment priority over supports to maintain pressure on your opponent.   
  * E.g. Rush comps.

### **4.5 Supports (Buffers/ Debuffers)**

Given the fast paced nature of RTA, there is a noticeable lack of support buffers in PVP compared to PVE. This is due to the fact many support buffers need time to ramp up their buffs (special skill, ultimate skill), and that their buffs scale better when there are more units on the field. This is difficult to achieve when your opponent is trying to kill your stuff.

There is an opportunity cost to bringing a buffer because a support unit’s utility competes with the raw stats of the units you would otherwise use in their place.

* There will be many weeks where units like Laura (through a combination of ASPD debuffs and her cat) can keep a frontline alive a lot longer than playing another frontline.   
* Buffers like AJia may enable your lineup to output more damage than if you had brought along another DPS.

| Common Buffer Options  |  |
| ----- | :---- |
| **Counter** | Machine Collector, Yang Harim, AJia, Arti Lana |
| **Mech** | N/A |
| **Soldier** | Revenant, Dorothy |

# **5.0 Role Identification**

Continuing from **Section 3.1 What is a Core?**, several example comps have been pulled off the leaderboard and annotated to better visualize how these roles are fulfilled within a team.

Keep in mind the Counterside meta shifts every week. Try to be cognizant that:

* What is good one week may not be strong in the next.   
* Unit selection will be made with consideration for what other people run.  
* Ship selection varies wildly between weeks due the regularity of bans.

This small collection of team comps is meant to illustrate team comps.

### 

## **5.1 Counter Comp Examples**

Counter comps are versatile and can take on a number of forms/ win conditions. 

| AJake Olivie |  |
| :---- | :---- |
|   (Insert more Olivie examples despair) | **What is the win condition** Use a combination of backline access and stall tools (Olivie, frontline, debuffs) to accumulate units and amass a deathball. **What is the core** Debuffers (RLaura, Serapel, Lucrecia) and a means to keep them alive.  **Additional commentary** Lucrecia applies an impactful 100% ASPD down debuff. As a flying ranger equipped with Maze CDR, she also deals good damage against defenders. Referring back to **Section 4.2.2 Anti-Strikers**, Rita Arsenico is a non-sniper anti-striker. Olivie enables/ complements a lot of stuff. There are numerous teams that run Olivie, but the way they function can vary wildly. |

| AYuna |  |
| :---- | :---- |
|   | **What is the win condition** Take advantage of AYuna’s %hp burn to grind through the enemy team. **What is the core** AYuna enables the comp through the utility her kit provides.  **Additional commentary** AYuna comps traditionally included Serapel to stack %hp burn, but this has fallen out of favor with the steady release of new units. Lucrecia applies an impactful 100% ASPD down debuff. As a flying ranger equipped with Maze CDR, she also deals good damage against defenders. Referring back to **Section 4.2.1 Anti-Defenders**, AYuna’s %hp burn allows her to perform a similar role to that of backline DPS units. Arti Lana is regularly used to start the Olivie proc. Her combination of sniper role, low cost, slow movement speed, and utility mesh well with the Olivie playstyle. Referring back to **Section 4.2.2 Anti-Strikers**, Rita Arsenico is a non-sniper anti-striker. |

| Replacer King |  |
| :---- | :---- |
|  | **What is the win condition** Enable Replacer King's conditional unlimited range and valid hits on basic attacks to destroy the opponent's backline and ship. **What is the core** Replacer King and Blue Bridge Mk2 have incredible synergy.  **Additional commentary** The Operator Serina Crew is a must use to have an advantage in the mirror match Raphaela is an incredibly dominant frontline unit and her kit fits this comp perfectly(if she is banned u will have a very hard time against rush teams). Awakened Shin Jia provides offensive support to Replacer King while also shielding the ship, which can be valuable in mirror matches (replaceable). Rearm Laura provides good field control capabilities at the start of a match (replaceable). Lucrecia applies an impactful 100% ASPD down debuff. As a flying ranger equipped with Maze CDR, she also deals good damage against defenders. RKing comps typically bring 1\~2 fodder units (e.g. Assault Troopers) to maintain uptime on RKing’s passive. |

| Replacer Queen |  |
| :---- | :---- |
|  | **What is the win condition** Queen survives to use ultimate to break the opponents backline. **What is the core** Replacer Queen **Additional commentary** Blue Bridge Mk2 allows queen to get ultimate faster which can be very impactful and helps Replacer Queen get away with trading haste for damage in gear choices.  Awakened Shin Jia helps queen survive and buffs queens’ damage substantially. Depending on the week she can be necessary to hit the damage required to end matches. Awakened Na Yubin is difficult to use most weeks with queen lead, lower cost defenders are often better. Referring back to **Section 4.2.2 Anti-Strikers**, Rita Arsenico is a non-sniper anti-striker. Rearmed Kang Soyoung is acting as frontline/stall. |

| Rush Comp |  |
| :---- | :---- |
|  | **What is the win condition** Overwhelm your opponent with cheap high value SSR units **What is the core** The entire team. **Additional commentary** The average cost is intentionally kept low to further push the advantage of not bringing an ASSR. Joo Shiyoon is used for the parry to nullify the effect of a skill. Given the fast-paced nature of the comp, parrying just once can be enough to justify his cost. See **Section 6.2 A Note on Rush Comps** for some elaboration on the conditions for these comps to function. |

### 

## **5.2 Mech Comp Examples**

Mech comps are characterized by their one-dimensional statcheck-y playstyle. Mechs (with exceptions) trade away their ultimate skill for a second passive. With access to potent buffs (Coffin-6 ship and Machine Collector), mech comps can quickly tap into heavy burst damage.  
 

| E1 |  |
| :---- | :---- |
|  | **What is the win condition** E1 comps are built around enabling E1. E1 is capable of winning games by clearing the enemy backline with its ultimate skill. **What is the core** E1 is the core to the comp. See also: [Prydwen Evolved-001 PVP Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j5DyHPH3IAMIWkmhrgetf5ClJG1GNcDNGPhNUHiv3oU/edit) **Additional commentary** E1’s unique sacrifice mechanic allows it to gain a stacking permanent buff for friendly mechs consumed on deployment. Glitch and Sparrows represent the cheapest practical way of feeding E1. |

| Mech Statcheck Comp |  |
| :---- | :---- |
|  | **What is the win condition** Set up a number of mech DPS units, stack buffs, and win off the burst of damage. **What is the core** Machine collector’s passive enables the statcheck by spiking the DPS on deploy. **Additional commentary** It is easy to stall out the mech statcheck. Its performance is heavily dependent on external factors (read: bans) |

### 

## **5.3 Soldier Comp Examples**

Soldier comps function similar to mechs but trade away much of the tankiness for even more damage, cheaper DP costs, with less setup. 

| Traditional Soldier Rush |  |
| :---- | :---- |
|   | **What is the win condition** Overwhelm the opponent’s frontline with cheap DPS before they can properly set up their backline. **What is the core** The entire team.  **Additional commentary** Soldier teams are notoriously gear heavy because every unit is expected to perform. Dorothy is a sniper but is primarily used as a buffer for the PE she applies on deploy. Referring back to **Section 4.3 Backline Access**, RKang can fulfill a damage/ tank role depending on the week. Glitch is an uncommon situational flex option primarily used to counter RTitan lead players. He can take anti-defender/ anti-striker DPS gear depending on the situation. |

| Curian |  |
| :---- | :---- |
|   | **What is the win condition** Same as traditional soldier rush, with Curian ultimate skill as insurance in the event the push stalls. **What is the core** Curian defines the Curian-variant soldier comp.  **Additional commentary** Although Curian is core to the comp, he may not be deployed in certain matchups. |

## **5.4 Other Comp Examples**

| Awakened Horizon |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| ![][image5] | **What is the win condition** Take advantage of AHori’s special skill reset to rapidly snowball the game out of control. **What is the core** AHori represents a significant portion of the damage in an AHori team.  **Additional commentary** Awakened Horizon “can” be played in a full mech team but she is primarily used in purpose-built comps that enable her. |

| Terror/ Siege |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| ![][image6] | **What is the win condition** Terror comps ignore the enemy team to directly attack the ship. **What is the core** Terror comps do not function in the same way as other comps. This is what the “alternate win condition” looks like. **Additional commentary** Terror and Siege seek to do the same thing (destroy the ship) but there are differences that separate them. See also: [Prydwen Siege Playbook](https://www.prydwen.gg/counter-side/guides/siege-playbook)  |

## 

## **5.5 Other Team Building Considerations**

### **5.5.1 Leader**

You can delegate a leader on your team of counters. Leader status conveys 

* 1 DP discount to the unit’s cost  
* Your starting hand consists of 3 random units from your team \+ your leader  
* Leading rearm units activates their “Leader Bonus”

Designating leaders can significantly improve the consistency of your composition. This primarily manifests in the form of:

* Consistent operator proc order: leading the first unit of the operator proc significantly improves consistency. This is especially relevant when the first unit is otherwise awkward to fit into the natural course of play/ “the meta”.  
  * Olivie (Sniper \-\> Defender \-\> Supporter) requires a sniper to start the proc order but snipers can be awkward to fit into teams. Referring to **Section 4.2.2 Anti-Strikers**, snipers are expensive (\~4DP), squishy, and not always ideal.  
  * Sigma’s (Defender \-\> Striker \-\> Ranger) proc order usually involves dropping two frontline units (until we get more backline striker DPS units). Being forced to deploy a striker from the start means you will need to cycle back to your frontline striker/ defender. This significantly delays the operator proc.  
* Ensuring an integral unit in your starting hand: certain comps are built around a particular unit’s ultimate skill (see **Section 4.2.3 A Note on Hypercarry Units**). These comps need their win condition on the field as soon as possible so they can start charging their ults.  
* Enabling rearm unit leader bonus: certain rearm units have impactful leader bonuses that incentivize leading them.

Choice of leader can often indicate the type of comp people are running.

### **5.5.2 Banned units**

The ban system is Counterside’s self-regulating way of managing units’ power levels post-release. “Banned” units incur a heavy cost and stat penalty, but this does not necessarily mean they are unplayable. Certain units are undercosted at base and are playable from ban 1\. Depending on the weekly meta and the state of your account, these units may be valid considerations in team building.

# **6.0 Introduction to the Positioning Metagame**

Units will move until they encounter an enemy in range at which point they begin attacking. It becomes exceedingly difficult to manipulate your own position once the units start piling up. That is to say, if you make a mistake positioning your frontline, there is next to nothing you can do to fix it.

A key element of the Counterside “metagame” comes from manipulating the initial frontline clash to create a favorable position to play from.

## **6.1 Camping**

### **6.1.1 What is Camping? Why Bother?**

Camping, playing from your side of the map (in extreme cases, directly under your own ship), is generally considered advantageous because you have considerably more freedom deciding where to deploy than your opponent. Your opponent can only (with exception) deploy in front of you and walk up. With some creativity, you can use this to great effect:

* You can freely deploy on your side of the field  
  * You have a “local majority of force” on your side of the map. This creates a DP advantage because your units reach the fight sooner than theirs.  
* You can redirect their frontline (and backline), they cannot redirect you  
* Your backline is bunched up, creating a meatball of valid hits that can be difficult to kill

In the vast majority of circumstances save for when you are running a comp inherently incompatible with camping (these are exceedingly rare), it is beneficial to camp. By camping, you open new options for yourself and deny your opponent decision-making opportunities. This is more easily said than done. 

Returning briefly to section **4.7 Frontlining for your Frontline**, there is a problem with the proposed solution of dropping a frontline unit in front of your pre-existing frontline: If my frontline unit is at the limit of my deployment range, how do I deploy something further up in front of it? 

There are two options:

1. Find a tanky unit with a dash (e.g. Spira) or some means of positioning themselves further up (e.g. Gremory, Raphaela).  
2. Avoid this situation by camping.

**Tl;dr There exists a metagame revolving around manipulating the location of the initial frontline clash.**

### 

### **6.1.2 Using Initial Deployments to set up a Camp**

Through a series of visual aids, it is possible to analyze players’ deployment habits and why this behavior exists. Assuming both players deploy a frontline unit at 10 DP that walks at the same speed, and make no subsequent deployments in the time it takes for the two to meet:

Deploying at same time

Getting Camped

The best course of action is for both players to deploy at their ship, at 10 DP. We can see from modeling out this interaction on a payoff matrix that the “nash equilibrium” lies at both players attempting a camp and subsequently clashing in the middle as a result.

**Tl;dr Put some thought behind where and when you drop your first unit.**

This is the typical, expected outcome when neither player has made any additional measures to gain a positional advantage. However, things change when players are willing to pay DP to secure a camping position.

### 

### **6.1.3 Paying a Premium to Camp**

Depending on the necessity, some comps will bring units that greatly facilitate setting up a camp. When both players are aware of the “camp metagame”, it can take some coaxing to get them to play a frontline unit. 

The umbrella term encompassing deliberate action intended to set up a camp is referred to as **“camp tech”**. Certain units have kits well suited to enabling a camp. In no order these are:

* **Stealthed units**: At the risk of taking ship damage, people will be forced to deploy something to distract the stealthed unit. Without stealth detection, these units will walk past the stealthed unit and towards your side of the map for you to set up the camp.  
  * E.g. Replacer Bishop, Glitch  
* **Bait units**: Some cheap (2\~3 DP) squishy backline unit you wouldn’t mind cycling to the back of your hand.  
  * E.g. Cheap anti-defender units, flying DPS units (Rosaria, Rita)  
* **Slow/ Stationary units**: As units will walk forward until they meet something in attack range, playing slow/ immobile units is an attractive way to force your opponent’s units to walk up while simultaneously conserving DP by putting it in a unit with better life expectancy (relative to other camping solutions).  
  * E.g. RTitan, Sigma (Tower), Tower Xiao Lin, Raphaela

| Common Camp Tech Options  |  |
| ----- | :---- |
| **Stealth** | Replacer Bishop, Glitch |
| **Bait\*** | Anything, Flying DPS Units |
| **Towers** | Sigma (Tower), Tower Xiao Lin, Raphaela |
| **Note:** The primary goal of these “camp tech” units is to pressure your opponent to play something that you can then use to set up the camp. These are not always possible to slot in. There is a clear opportunity cost to bring “camp tech”. Generally speaking you are: Sacrificing a team slot to bring them Pressured to lead for consistency Announcing to the world you will be camping them Playing from a DP deficit until you can convert your positional advantage into a DP advantage \*This is situational. |  |

**Tl;dr No informed player willingly lets themselves get camped.**

### 

### **6.1.4 Negative DP Camping (Are You Fatherless?)**

This all raises the question: Why can’t I just let my opponent walk up before deploying? 

Functionally speaking, spending DP on “camp tech” is the same as watching an equivalent amount of DP overcap waiting for your opponent to cross the map. The end result (provided your opponent cooperates) is you achieve a camping position. You would be correct, and this is what people did, and it has been patched out.

**Being inactive for 18 seconds will trigger the game’s auto-deploy system.** 

Where previously it was possible to stare at your opponent for 3 minutes, you are now forced to act. In spite of this rule, the staring-contest-interaction still exists in a limited sense. Due to mutual distrust, many players will hold off their deployment until 2:43, or wait for the other party to play first.

**Tl;dr Expect to deploy at 2:43.**

## 

### **6.1.5 Camping Risk**

Camping comes with its own intrinsic risks. Assuming you are taking full advantage of the opportunities made possible by camping:

* If your frontline is prone to hitstun, they can be pushed back into your backline and everyone will die horrifically.  
* Your backline is especially susceptible to splash damage because they are bunched up.  
* Your ship is more likely to take damage because your opponent is so close to it. If you are unable to turn your positional camp advantage into a material advantage, you will lose at 3 minutes to ship chip damage.

In theory, a camp comp would address these risks and have a means of mitigating them.

## **6.2 A Note on Rush Comps**

You can forward deploy your units at 3:00, but this does not make the comp a “rush comp”. Referring back to the payoff matrix in **Section 6.1.2 Using Initial Deployments to set up a Camp**, this implies giving the opponent a camping position for free.

What differentiates a properly executed rush comp from willingly letting yourself get camped? (~~Gear lol.~~)

### **6.2.1 When is Rush Playable?**

Rush comps are better understood when contextualized within the week they are played. The rush comps themselves are very one-dimensional in the way they play. There is a lot of macro-oriented decision-making that goes into determining if the comp is good, and if you should queue with one.

The choice to bring a rush comp depends on several factors:

* Would I rather play the meta-comp mirror match or run an anti-meta rush comp?  
  * Are there enough people queuing with comps I have a favorable matchup into?  
  * Given a rough estimate of my winrate, will I be able to climb like this?  
* Is my gear enough to DPS check my opponent?   
  * Can I statcheck their stall fast enough?

Oftentimes it will be the case that the week’s stall options are too strong to realistically smash through. Among other things, assess the weekly meta for:

* High value cheap frontline units (e.g. Raphaela, RKaci, RAlex)  
* Backline stall (i.e. Spira, Gremory)  
* Easily accessible crowd control (e.g. Pod Type S1)

It should become quickly apparent from viewing the leaderboards if rush is a viable comp for the week. See also **Section 7.3 Copy the Leaderboards**.

**Tl;dr Much of the Rush comps decision-making is made outside the match.**

## **6.3 Additional Positioning Considerations**

### **6.3.1 Meeting at the Middle**

It is important to keep in mind that the intention to camp may not always translate into a camping position. Referring back to the payoff matrix in **Section 6.1.2 Using Initial Deployments to set up a Camp**, you can expect to meet in the middle.

Meeting in the middle does not represent a failure to camp. Optimistically speaking, this could mean successfully preventing yourself from getting camped.

**Tl;dr You can expect to play most of your games from the middle of the map.**

### **6.3.2 Resetting Off a Bad Push**

There is a heavy emphasis on using initial deployments to manipulate positioning because it is incredibly difficult to fix once the game is going. However, it is possible to “reset” off a push.

Oftentimes you will find your units walking into a doomed push. Rather than commit units to attempt to bruteforce your way to the enemy ship, it may be better to hold dp and let your units die to “reset” your positioning. You can then use your opponent’s encroaching team to achieve a camp.

**Tl;dr Use a “doomed push” as an opportunity to fix your positioning.**

# **7.0 Miscellaneous RTA Commentary \-Remove section to another guide.**

\-I DUN WANNA WRITE NO MORE I’M TIRED I’M TIRED I’M TIRED

### **7.1 “Meta” Comp vs. “Anti-Meta” Comp**

“There are 2 kinds of comps in a given week. The meta comps, which consist of the strongest units that week, and the anti-meta comps, which consist of units that counter the meta units. ”  
\-Pie\#3672, Counter:Side Beginner’s Guide to PVP

Taken from another RTA guide, this is a succinct description of the RTA queue I’m fond of. However, it can lead to the misconception that if someone isn’t playing a clear anti-meta comp (e.g. Anti-RKing vs. RKing in a week everyone is playing RKing), they exist outside “the meta”. There is no such thing as a “meta-independent” comp. Every comp has clear favored/ unfavored matchups. 

To illustrate an example, a team must have some form of backline access to deal with RQueen on a week RQueen comps are oppressive\*. The alternative is watching RQueen outscale your team with no way of reaching her. 

\*Granted, this would never happen in the first place unless all the backline access tools were to be banned or rendered unusable by some means.

**Tl;dr Utilize the “flex slots” in your comp to address the most popular strategies on a given week.**

### **7.2 Winning Doing Nothing**

At any given point in time if both players stopped deploying, one player would win with the units on the field. Being able to identify etc. etc.  
7.2.1 Holding DP/ Play Reactively  
\-We actually do need to write out this section ;\_;

### **7.3 Copy the Leaderboards**

The leaderboard publicly lists the top 200 rated players. It may be a good idea to set aside some time browsing the comps to gauge the meta and find inspiration for your own team.

Leaderboard-to-Team Decision-Making Model walk through I dun wanna write this out...  
7.3.0 Determine weekly meta, personal strengths   
(e.g. is my account geared for a particular comp?)  
7.3.1 Apply role identification   
	(Who is the frontline, damage, backline access, what is the core?)  
7.3.2 Identify alternatives  
	(Who is replaceable? Is there a better alternative? How do I use the flex slots?)  
7.3.3 Test in queue/ Adjust as needed  
		(Tweak flex slots, alternatives as needed)

**Tl;dr Let someone else go through the experimentation process and copy their homework.**
