She's also a swift swordswoman who uses daggers to blow away beneficial effects cast on enemies.\n\n　Among the students of the Academy, Yen Xing is known as a stern senior, but personally, she wants everyone to treat her like a friend. The charisma and seriousness she exudes is only due to her upbringing; on the inside she's just like other girls her age who love children and animals.\n　But even the numerous rumors about her that circulate in school can't refute that she's a born leader.As a master of the traditional martial arts, she earns a lot of money teaching children of rich familiies, but she donates almost all her wealth to the Academy and the society. Also, she doesn't treat other students differently because of who they are.\n　She believes it's necessary for everyone to accept each other's differences to achieve perfect harmony. Her belief doesn't seem to be empty idealism, given how successful she has been as the leader of a Council filled with unique characters that rarely agree with each other."
