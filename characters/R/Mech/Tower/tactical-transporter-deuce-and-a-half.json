A fully-equipped squad can be loaded in the back.\n　Although the vehicle's body is bullet-proof, it doesn't have combat abilities. It is mainly used to quickly transport infantry units from another area. It has recently received criticism regarding its lack of Corruption ray defense, but no particular countermeasures have been implemented until now.\n　A report says that some Steel Lane infantry units are sneaking out of work, hiding in the back of this vehicle. Security guards should be aware of this. "
