But ever since she unexpectedly showed up on TV, she started streaming on NetTube for the few fans she acquired.\n　She is terrible at both playing games and sniping, but she has many stable fans because she is always live except when she's asleep. At first, she was called Mi-Whale for her large figure, but to the delight of her fans, she rapidly lost weight due to her rigorous streaming schedule.\n　She is still criticized for her lame jokes during opening remarks, and the self-composed song used as the closing theme, but she insists on keeping them.
