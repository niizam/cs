He is the only member who stayed in Fenrir Squad after Hilde disappeared. Many people in the company assume that he only retained his position to keep getting his salary without working.\n　The leaders of the 52-minute Week Movement and the maintenance team's Drunk-on-duty Incident claim that they had spoken to him before their actions. The Managerial Department is suspecting that he instigated the protests because he wanted to create justifiable reasons to slack off. "
