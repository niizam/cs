It is her hobby and daily routine to observe Counters and collect their data, and the ultimate goal of this study is to achieve her dream of becoming an assistant suitable for the strongest hero. To lay the groundwork for her future career, she established a club called the Special Hero Class to study children of her age, since young Counters these days tend to have extraordinary abilities compared to their seniors. Of course, to other people, the club just looks like a playground for the three children."
